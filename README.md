### 1. Visibility of system status 
(N) Throughout the landing page, each article has its subject category on top of the feature image so that users know what type of article they are about to engage with. Ads are also labeled as ads (1)

(N) Whenever a user clicks on to an article and the article needs a little bit of time to load, a “loading” sign pops-up on the screen until the user is transferred to the desired article (1)

(N) Whenever a user clicks on to an article and the article needs a little bit of time to load, a “loading” sign pops-up on the screen until the user is transferred to the desired article (1)

(R29) Throughout the landing page, each article has its subject category on top of the feature image so that users know what type of article they are about to engage with (1)
#### Evaluation: Both websites clearly visually categorize article content so that users know ahead of time what type of content they may be about to engage with. Both websites give users notice of loading time, so users are not left wondering whether or not their browser and computer have received their cursor command. 

### 2. Match between system and the real world 
(N) Article labels use terms like “fashion,”  “beauty,” “entertainment,” to categorize articles. These terms are easy to understand and makes knowing ahead of clicking what types of content may be discussed (1)

(N) The website also uses the terms “ It Girl,” “Nylon Nineteen,” and “Election Diaries” as article subject labels which aren’t as clear. Users must click on multiple posts with these labels in order to understand what subject matter is being discussed in each post (3)

(N) The website has a category label in bold that says “Latest,” but the articles featured under and nearest to it are all trending articles–trending from the amount of clicks received–that aren’t actually the last posts uploaded at the time users load the page (3)

(R29) Article labels use terms like “news,”  “beauty,” “horoscope,” “2020 election,” and “fashion” to categorize articles. These terms are easy to understand and makes knowing ahead of clicking what types of content may be discussed (1)

(R29) The website also uses the terms “ Prime Day,” “Money Diaries,” and “Election Diaries” as article subject labels which aren’t as clear. Users must click on multiple posts with these labels in order to understand what subject matter is being discussed in each post (3)

(R29) The website has category labels in bold that say “Today on R29,” “Trending on R29” and “Now on R29” with articles underneath each section. While the jump from timely content to most clicked content back to timely content is slight disjointed, the catergories being labled clearly makes it easier for users to understand the timeliness of the content they are seeing (2) 
#### Evaluation: Refinery 29 does a better job of conveying to their website users through content category labels what type of posts are being presented although some of the labels used are too niche too know what they are indicating prior to reading them. Nylon also uses niche category labels for some content that website users have to figure out the context for by reading multiple articles. Nylon also needs to better categorize content on their website so that it’s easier to understand the timeliness of the posts being shown. 

### 3. User control and freedom 
(N) There is a “menu” button in bold, large letters at the top right corner of the page that opens up and showcases the content categories articles are labeled by. Users are able to click on a category and be taken to all the posts under said category (1)

(N) There is a search function included in the drop down of the “menu” button which users can use to search for articles based on the words included in them. The menu button also moves down as the user scrolls down and stays visible even when jumping to different articles so that they can access it at anytime (1)

(N) Some of the content labels used on the site like “Election Diaries” and “It Girl” are not available to click on in the drop down menu which makes it more difficult to access all of their posts (3)

(N) When a user selects an article to read, the name of the article’s author appears under the title. Users can then click on the name and see all the articles the author has written in chronological order (1)

(N) Once a user clicks on an article, scrolls to read the article, and finishes the article a new article immediately starts right after without warning or a buffer. The scrolling is endless. The next article to appear also does not correlate with the category of the article the user initially clicked on to (3)  

(N) There isn’t an exist button or a button that specifically says to return to the menu. Users have to know to click the websites logo name to return home. The logo name is visible on all parts of the website (2)

(R29) There is a menu button at the top of the page labeled with different actions users may wish to take: “Discover,” “Watch,” “Shop,” and “More.” Each button drops down to showcase content options for users to engage with. The “More” button stores the content categories that posts are labeled by. Users are able to click on a category and be taken to all the posts under said category (1) 

(R29) Some of the content labels used on the site like “Amazon” and “Amazon Prime Day” are not available to click on in the drop down menu which makes it more difficult to access all of their posts (3)

(R29) When a user selects an article to read, the name of the article’s author appears under the title. Users can then click on the name and see all the articles the author has written in chronological order (1)

(R29) When a user selects an article to read, the date the article was published is visible under the article’s name and author. Users can then click on the date and see all the articles published on that same date. On that same page, users are also able choose a specific publish date besides the one they initially clicked on to (1)

(R29) There is a search function included in the navigation menu at the top of the page that stays visible everywhere the user navigates to (1)

(R29) Refinery 29 has four websites dedicated to four countries of their audience base. There is a button at the top of the page that says the name of each country–“United States,” “United Kingdom,” “Germany,” “France,” and “Canada Users of the website can click on it and pick which country they’d like to see content from (1) 

(R29) There isn’t a button specifically labled for returning home, but users can click on the website’s name and be taken back to the homepage. The name is always visable no matter where the user navigates (2)
#### Evaluation: Both websites grant users a functional level of control and freedom on their sites. Refinery 29’s site grants users more freedom to navigate around the site and posts through its cataloging system as well as see the other editions of its publications based on country. 

### 4. Consistency and standards 
(N) Even though users have to read multiple articles to understand the context of why certain posts are labeled as “It Girl” or “Election Diaries,” the website consistently uses these terms  respectivly for articles that involve interviewing some sort of figure–celebrity, movie star, singer, activist, etc–or involve talking about the 2020 elections (1)  

(N) Hyperlinked texts in articles are always underlined (1)

(N) The website follows the convention of the website name being a home button (1)

(R29) Hyperlinked texts in articles are always underlined with green and turn red when hovered over (1)

(R29) When users hover their mouse of the website’s menu function where users are able to switch from different countries’ editions of the publication, the name of the country does not change color. When clicked, there is no loading symbol that appears. The site breaks it’s own menu rule (2)  

(R29) The website follows the convention of the website name being a home button (1)

(R29) Even though users have to read multiple articles to understand the context of why certain posts are labeled as “Prime” or “Amazon Prime Day,” the website consistently uses these terms respectivly for listicles that involve buying something specifically from Amazon or Amazon’s “Prime Day” sale (1) 
#### Evaluation: Both websites are relatively consistent and follow Jakob’s Law by following much of the formatting digital publications tend to follow. Refinery29’s site slips up in one section of their menu. 

### 5. Error prevention 
(N) No error prevention is offered (1)

R29) No error prevention is offered (1)
#### Evaluation: The nature of both sites doesn’t lend itself to much user error as it’s purpose is to showcase articles and sometimes video content to users.  

### 6. Recognition rather than recall 
(R29) Users must rely on recall in order to search articles up. When typing, the nothing is suggested to make it easier for them to ask if users are looking for a particular article in mind (3)

(N) Users must rely on recall in order to search articles up. When typing, nothing is suggested to make it easier for them to ask a particular article in mind (3)
#### Evaluation: Both sites have users rely on recall more than recognition mainly when hunting down posted articles. Refinery29 leaves users with more recognition tools to search for content than Nylon does.

### 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use 
(N)  Users are able to hunt down particular articles by using their content category label, author name, or by searching the title (2)

(R29)  Users are able to hunt down particular articles by using their content category label, author name, date published, or by searching the title (2) 
#### Evaluation: Both sites grant users a good level of flexibility in their use when it comes to searching for articles. Users may Refinery29’s chronological-based search function makes it much more flexible than Nylon’s site.

### 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design 
(N) Pastel colors are used for headings while aritcle body is always in white. Text is always black and in all caps (1)  

(N) Articles are spread out enough for users to be able to differientiate between each post (1) 

(R29) Articles are spread out enough for users to be able to differientiate between each post, and each post is placed in it’s own bordered off box (1) 

(R29) Articles are always over white backgrounds and text is always black (1)
#### Evaluation: Both websites employ minimalistic designs and aesthetics for their respective sites that fit with their branding but is easy for users to view and navigate. 

### 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors 
(N) If a user types in something to the search bar that the site cannot recognize or just doesn’t have, it will say “No Results” (1)

(R29) If a user types in something to the search bar that the site cannot recognize or just doesn’t have, it will say “Bummer! 0 results found” (1)
#### Evaluation: The nature of how users navigate both sites is generally limited, so little error notification is necessary. Where error may occur, users are notified. 

### 10. Help and documentation 
(N) Little help is given. Users are expected to navigate the sight fully on their own (3)

(N) Users are not able to contact the site’s publishers directly, only the parent company. Users have to know to click on the “About” page in the drop down menu to access the parent company’s site and then scroll all the way to the botton for contact information (3) 

(R29) Little help is given. Users are expected to navigate the sight fully on their own (3)

(R29) There is a “Feedback” button at the bottom of the page where users may email the publication if they need to (1) 
#### Evaluation: Since both sites are built with the assumption that users are simply there to click through the content presented, neither sites leave much guidance or help to users. Refinery29 makes it much easier for users to contact by having a “Feedback” button at the bottom of the page while Nylon make it more difficult. This could be because both sites often post opinion pieces which may be unfavorable to some. Rather than dealing with many emails of complaints or verbal abuse, both publications have buffered contact.
