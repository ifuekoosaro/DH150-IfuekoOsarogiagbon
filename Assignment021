## Pilot Usability Test by Ifueko Osarogiagbon
### Introduction 
Nylon Magazine is a digital publication that houses news, op-eds, and interviews of famous figures and gamechangers in pop culture. Users are able to scroll theough the websites homepage to see the latest articles about everything within the real including celebrity drama, makeup releases, fashion brand launches, casting announcements, tv show reviews, and more. Users are also able to pick specifically what subject of article – beauty, fashion, entertainment, life, etc – they wish to read.

Task 2 and 3 will test user's ability to use the search function in order to find old articles from the website's archieving system so that I may have a better understanding of the limits on control and freedom Nylon.com's current interace has. 
Due to the current pandemic, the pilot usability test will be conducted remotely. I will be modering from my own room while my participant will take the test from a quiet place of their choosing. The test will be recorded through zoom. I will have the participant open two browsers–one for the test and the other for  the website– side by side. The participant will also have their screen shared so that I may guide them through the usability test. I will give the participant a general briefing of the usablity test, have them sign a consent form, and then have them do a pre-test questionnaire. Then the participant will be asked to conduct the three tasks while thing out loud. After these tasks are completed, the participant will fil out another questionnaire that gages their opinion about the website's usability and their experience taking the test. Finally I will have the participant fill out a
